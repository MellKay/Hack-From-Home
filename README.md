TO DO:

functionality
1. if 'yes' is clicked on enjoy question, direct to the 'play' button for the avatar, then add 1 to the happiness 
2. if 'yes' is clicked on the health question (CHANGE THIS TO HAVE WE WASHED), direct to the clean button for the avatar, then add 1 to health 
3. if  'yes' is clicked on the eaten question, direct to the 'feed' button for the avatar, then add 1 to hunger 
4. add a question 'did we get any sleep last night?', if responded 'yes' direct to the sleep button for the avatar and add 1 to the health bar

- create a question for 'did we sleep last night?' with yes and no functionality
- change the doc/med question to 'have we washed today?' so it links in with the clean button better
