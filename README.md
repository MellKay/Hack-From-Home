# Ani-Mate

## Motivation

Ani-Mate is a virtual pet designed with self care in mind. Currently large parts of the world are experiencing lockdown and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of people will feel particularly distressed and those with existing mental health issues may be struggling to adjust. Our team wanted to create something to help combat depression and anxiety for what will be for many a traumatic time.

## Overview

Ani is your new companion, and encourages the user to exercise self care by reminding them to eat, wash, exercise as well as asking them how they are doing.

There are three targets in the form of "HP bars" representing health (exercise, grooming), hunger (eating) and happiness (general feeling) and the user can increase these by confirming if they have done those things with Ani. You take a shower, Ani grooms. You eat, so does Ani!

Importantly there's no penalisation for not doing those tasks as we felt this would not incentivise the user to keep on engaging with Ani, but the user can defer things if they want for her to ask later.

If the user hasn't interacted for some time Ani sends a push notification to gently ask if they're okay? We'd also like to include something whereby if the user is not positively engaging to suggest ways they can reach out and get help (e.g. call a friend or family member, or any other form of support including mental health services).

TO DO:

functionality

1. if 'yes' is clicked on enjoy question, direct to the 'play' button for the avatar, then add 1 to the happiness
2. if 'yes' is clicked on the health question (CHANGE THIS TO HAVE WE WASHED), direct to the clean button for the avatar, then add 1 to health
3. if 'yes' is clicked on the eaten question, direct to the 'feed' button for the avatar, then add 1 to hunger
4. add a question 'did we get any sleep last night?', if responded 'yes' direct to the sleep button for the avatar and add 1 to the health bar

- create a question for 'did we sleep last night?' with yes and no functionality
- change the doc/med question to 'have we washed today?' so it links in with the clean button better

include push notification as the question itself: click yes or no. If they click yes, add a point, if they click no, make suggestions.
